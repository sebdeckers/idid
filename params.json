You can find yours at [https://idonethis.com/api/token/](https://idonethis.com/api/token/).\r\n- `team`: The team where you want to post your dones to. Notice the team name sometimes doesn't match the display name shown in the website. To make sure you have the correct team name, open your team URL in [iDoneThis web interface](https://idonethis.com/), and see the resulting URL. For example, I have a personal team called \"Work\", but the URL is `https://idonethis.com/cal/work-td3a/`, therefore, I'll use `work-td3a` as my team in my configuration file.\r\n\r\nBe careful of writing invalid JSON to the configuration file, or you will get an \"invalid\" error. Remember that the keys should be surrounded with double quotes as well.\r\n\r\nAn example of a configuration would be:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"token\": \"1234123412341234123412341234123412341234\",\r\n  \"team\": \"work-td3a\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease don't hesitate in [opening an ticket](https://github.com/jviotti/idid/issues/new) if you need any help setting up `idid.`\r\n\r\nContribute\r\n----------\r\n\r\n- Issue Tracker: [github.com/jviotti/idid/issues](https://github.com/jviotti/idid/issues)\r\n- Source Code: [github.com/jviotti/idid](https://github.com/jviotti/idid)\r\n\r\nBefore submitting a PR, please make sure that you include tests, and that [coffeelint](http://www.coffeelint.org/) runs without any warning:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ gulp lint\r\n```\r\n\r\nSupport\r\n-------\r\n\r\nIf you're having any problem, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/jviotti/idid/issues/new) on GitHub.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThe project is licensed under the MIT license.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
